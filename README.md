# CLRS Codes

Collection of algorithm implementations from the _Introduction to Algorithms (Fourth Edition)_ book by Thomas H. Cormen, _et. al_. The goal of this repository is to provide clean, well-documented implementations of algorithms discussed in the book using Python.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/irinamrdhtllh/clrs-codes.git
cd clrs-codes

```
2. Run specific algorithms or data structures. For example:
```bash
python sorting/merge_sort.py
```
